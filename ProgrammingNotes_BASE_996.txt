- Methods of protecting routes
  - Store currentuser in local storage, check localstorage when app first loads 
    and have app call onAuthStateChanged to refresh localstorage
  - Use `PrivateRoute` component, have it check if authenticated and either load
    load protected route or redirect
    - Need to have a way of having other authconditions like `role`
    - Can have some kind of loading functionality that waits for onAuthStateChanged
  - Using higher order component
    - Can add loading/pending to HOC
      X with loading component can refresh protected route without being redirected
